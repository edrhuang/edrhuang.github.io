                <p>Born and raised in the Bay Area. I Spent a lot of time swimming, playing soccer, and drawing stuff. As I got older I got pretty good at swimming and it quickly consumed my entire life. My life was revolved around insane practice schedules and traveling to far away competitions. Swimming taught me to be patient and hard work will yield results. Eventually I swam fast enough, got accepted into Cal Poly and joined the swim team. At school I Majored in Graphic Communications with a concentration in Web and Digital Media. I sacrificed a large part of my life for swimming and towards the end of my junior year I realized I wanted to do more. I stopped swimming and began doing all the things I never had the energy or time to do. I found a real interest in the outdoors. I began bouldering and going on backpacking trips with friends. I found new hobbies and picked up old ones. Started to dabble more in photography and improve my web design skills.

                <p>Growing up I spent a great deal of time at our family's printing business. We had a small, but innovative little shop. As analog printing slowly faded away and digital began taking over, my dad utilized new technology and changed his business. The online market was growing and he explained to me that the future was online. At school I felt somewhat bored because of a large part of the curriculum revolved around print. The classes taught fundamentals which is very useful for designing, but I could not find interest. To be honest I thought I had made a mistake choosing my major, until I took my first real web design class.<br>

<br>My experience with web design began in high school where I took a very basic web design class. The class taught Dreamweaver to create simple web sites. It wasn't until college where I tried to learn HTML and CSS to build websites. After discovering my interest in Web Design I began searching to learn more. I began reading blogs and following up on interesting trends in the web design world. I find a lot pleasure in building things and I believe that flows over into web design. I love watching the progress of a blank page turn into a beautiful collection of typography, photos, and interactivity.</p>
